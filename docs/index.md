# Introduction

## What is Galileo’s dataquality?

**dataquality** is a Python library that enables data scientists to build high-performing models quickly, with better quality training data. With a few lines of code added during training or during an inference run, dataquality instantly finds data errors.

Galileo inspects data, discovers errors and helps you improve labels. It offers a per-sample holistic data quality score, called the DEP Score, to identify samples in the dataset that are contributing to low or high model performance. The DEP score measures the potential for “misfit” of an observation to the given model. The samples with the highest DEP scores are considered “hard for the model” to learn from during training or “hard” for the model to make predictions on at test time. On the other hand, samples with the lowest DEP scores are considered “easy for the model” to learn from during training or “easy” for the model to make predictions on at test time.

What dataquality does:

- Compute a data quality score

- Find likely mislabeled samples

- Provide insights into the dataset
