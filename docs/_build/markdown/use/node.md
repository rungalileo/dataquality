# Node

## Introduction

It is assumed you have successfully installed [dataquality-node](./). To
verify this you can run the command `vnode --help`. If that prints a
list of commands, the installation is completed. Also, make sure that
Docker is running.

**NOTE**: An organization runs a node for each of the collaborations it participates
in

### Quick start

To create a new node, run the command below. A menu will be started that
allows you to set up a node configuration file. For more details, check
out the Configure section.

```default
vnode new
```

To run a node, execute the command below. The `--attach` flag will
cause log output to be printed to the console.

```default
vnode start --name <your_node> --attach
```

Finally, a node can be stopped again with:

```default
vnode stop --name <your_node>
```

### Available commands

Below is a list of all commands you can run for your node(s). To see all
available options per command use the `--help` flag,
i.e. `vnode start --help` .

See the following sections on how to configure and maintain a
dataquality-node instance:


* Configure


* Security


* Logging

## Configure

The dataquality-node requires a configuration file to run. This is a
`yaml` file with a specific format. To create an initial configuration
file, start the configuration wizard via: `vnode new` . You can also
create and/or edit this file manually.

The directory where the configuration file is stored depends on your
operating system (OS). It is possible to store the configuration file at
**system** or at **user** level. By default, node configuration files
are stored at **user** level. The default directories per OS are as
follows:

**WARNING**: The command `vnode` looks in certain directories by default. It is
possible to use any directory and specify the location with the `--config`
flag. However, note that using a different directory requires you to
specify the `--config` flag every time!

### Configuration file structure

Each node instance (configuration) can have multiple environments. You
can specify these under the key `environments` which allows four
types: `dev` , `test`,`acc` and `prod` . If you do not want to
specify any environment, you should only specify the key `application`
(not within `environments`) .

<details>
<summary><a>Example configuration file</a></summary>```yaml
application:

  # API key used to authenticate at the server.
  api_key: ***

  # URL of the dataquality server
  server_url: https://petronas.dataquality.ai

  # port the server listens to
  port: 443

  # API path prefix that the server uses. Usually '/api' or an empty string
  api_path: ''

  # subnet of the VPN server
  vpn_subnet: 10.76.0.0/16

  # add additional environment variables to the algorithm containers.
  # this could be usefull for passwords or other things that algorithms
  # need to know about the node it is running on
  # OPTIONAL
  algorithm_env:

    # in this example the environment variable 'player' has
    # the value 'Alice' inside the algorithm container
    player: Alice

  # specify custom Docker images to use for starting the different
  # components.
  # OPTIONAL

    node: harbor2.dataquality.ai/infrastructure/node:petronas
    alpine: harbor2.dataquality.ai/infrastructure/alpine
    vpn_client: harbor2.dataquality.ai/infrastructure/vpn_client
    network_config: harbor2.dataquality.ai/infrastructure/vpn_network

  # path or endpoint to the local data source. The client can request a
  # certain database to be used if it is specified here. They are
  # specified as label:local_path pairs.
  databases:
    default: D:\data\datafile.csv

  # end-to-end encryption settings
  encryption:

    # whenever encryption is enabled or not. This should be the same
    # as the `encrypted` setting of the collaboration to which this
    # node belongs.
    enabled: false

    # location to the private key file
    private_key: /path/to/private_key.pem

  # To control which algorithms are allowed at the node you can set
  # the allowed_images key. This is expected to be a valid regular
  # expression
  allowed_images:
    - ^harbor.dataquality.ai/[a-zA-Z]+/[a-zA-Z]+

  # credentials used to login to private Docker registries
  docker_registries:
    - registry: docker-registry.org
      username: docker-registry-user
      password: docker-registry-password

  # Settings for the logger
  logging:
      # Controls the logging output level. Could be one of the following
      # levels: CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG, NOTSET
      level:        DEBUG

      file:         my_node.log

      use_console:  True

      # The number of log files that are kept, used by RotatingFileHandler
      backup_count: 5

      # Size kb of a single log file, used by RotatingFileHandler
      max_size:     1024

      # format: input for logging.Formatter,
      format:       "%(asctime)s - %(name)-14s - %(levelname)-8s - %(message)s"

  # directory where local task files (input/output) are stored

```

</details>**NOTE**: We use [DTAP for key environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development,_testing,_acceptance_and_production).
In short:


* `dev`: Development environment. It is ok to break things here


* `test`: Testing environment. Here, you can verify that everything
works as expected. This environment should resemble the target
environment where the final solution will be deployed as much as
possible.


* `acc`: Acceptance environment. If the tests were successful, you can
try this environment, where the final user will test his/her analysis
to verify if everything meets his/her expectations.


* `prod`: Production environment. The version of the proposed solution
where the final analyses are executed.

### Configure using the Wizard

The most straightforward way of creating a new server configuration is
using the command `vnode new` which allows you to configure the most
basic settings.

By default, the configuration is stored at user level, which makes this
configuration available only for your user. In case you want to use a
system directory you can add the `--system` flag when invoking the
`vnode new` command.

### Update configuration

To update a configuration you need to modify the created `yaml` file.
To see where this file is located, you can use the command
`vnode files` . Do not forget to specify the flag `--system` in case
of a system-wide configuration or the `--user` flag in case of a
user-level configuration.

### Local test setup

Check the section on [Local test setup](server.md#use-server-local) of the server if
you want to run both the node and server on the same machine.

## Security

As a data owner it is important that you take the necessary steps to
protect your data. dataquality allows algorithms to run on your data and
share the results with other parties. It is important that you review
the algorithms before allowing them to run on your data.

Once you approved the algorithm, it is important that you can verify
that the approved algorithm is the algorithm that runs on your data.
There are two important steps to be taken to accomplish this:


* Set the (optional) `allowed_images` option in the
node-configuration file. You can specify a regex expression here. For
example


    1. `^harbor2.dataquality.ai/[a-zA-Z]+/[a-zA-Z]+`: allows all images
from the dataquality registry


    2. `^harbor2.dataquality.ai/algorithms/glm`: only allows this specific
image, but all builds of this image


    3. `^harbor2.dataquality.ai/algorithms/glm@sha256:82becede498899ec668628e7cb0a`
`d87b6e1c371cb8a1e597d83a47fac21d6af3`:
allows only this specific build from the GLM to run on your data


* Enable `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST` to verify the origin of the image.
For more details see the [documentation from
Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/).

**WARNING**: By enabling `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST` you might not be able to use
certain algorithms. You can check this by verifying that the images you want
to be used are signed.

In case you are using our Docker repository you need to use
harbor**2**.dataquality.ai as harbor.dataquality.ai does not have a notary.

## Logging

Logging is enabled by default. To configure the logger, look at the logging section
in the example configuration file in Configuration file structure.

<!-- todo update link above -->
Useful commands:


1. `vnode files`: shows you where the log file is stored


2. `vnode attach`: shows live logs of a running server in your current
console. This can also be achieved when starting the node with
`vnode start --attach`
