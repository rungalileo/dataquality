# Server

## Introduction

It is assumed that you successfully installed the dataquality install-server. To
verify this, you can run the command `vserver --help` . If that prints a list of
commands, your installation is successful. Also, make sure that Docker
is running.

### Quick start

To create a new server, run the command below. A menu will be started
that allows you to set up a server configuration file.

```default
vserver new
```

For more details, check out the Configure section.

To run a server, execute the command below. The `--attach` flag will
copy log output to the console.

```default
vserver start --name <your_server> --attach
```

**WARNING**: When the server is run for the first time, the following user is created:


* username: root


* password: root

It is recommended to change this password immediately.

Finally, a server can be stopped again with:

```default
vserver stop --name <your_server>
```

### Available commands

The following commands are available in your environment. To see all the
options that are available per command use the `--help` flag,
e.g. `vserver start --help`.

The following sections explain how to use these commands to configure
and maintain a dataquality-server instance:


* Configure


* Batch import


* server-deployment


* Logging


* Shell

## Configure

The dataquality-server requires a configuration file to run. This is a
`yaml` file with specific contents. You can create and edit this file
manually. To create an initial configuration file you can also use the
configuration wizard: `vserver new`.

The directory where to store the configuration file depends on you
operating system (OS). It is possible to store the configuration file at
**system** or at **user** level. By default, server configuration files
are stored at **system** level. The default directories per OS are as
follows:

**WARNING**: The command `vserver` looks in certain directories by default. It is
possible to use any directory and specify the location with the `--config`
flag. However, note that using a different directory requires you to specify
the `--config` flag every time!

### Configuration file structure

Each server instance (configuration) can have multiple environments. You
can specify these under the key `environments` which allows four
types: `dev` ,`test`, `acc` and `prod` . If you do not want to
specify any environment, you should only specify the key `application`
(not within `environments`) .

<details>
<summary><a>Example configuration file</a></summary>```yaml
application:
  ...
environments:
  test:

    # Human readable description of the server instance. This is to help
    # your peers to identify the server
    description: Test

    # Should be prod, acc, test or dev. In case the type is set to test
    # the JWT-tokens expiration is set to 1 day (default is 6 hours). The
    # other types can be used in future releases of dataquality
    type: test

    # IP adress to which the server binds. In case you specify 0.0.0.0
    # the server listens on all interfaces
    ip: 0.0.0.0

    # Port to which the server binds
    port: 5000

    # API path prefix. (i.e. https://yourdomain.org/api_path/<endpoint>). In the
    # case you use a referse proxy and use a subpath, make sure to include it
    # here also.
    api_path: /api

    # The URI to the server database. This should be a valid SQLAlchemy URI,
    # e.g. for an Sqlite database: sqlite:///database-name.sqlite,
    # or Postgres: postgresql://username:password@172.17.0.1/database).
    uri: sqlite:///test.sqlite

    # This should be set to false in production as this allows to completely
    # wipe the database in a single command. Useful to set to true when
    # testing/developing.
    allow_drop_all: True

    # The secret key used to generate JWT authorization tokens. This should
    # be kept secret as others are able to generate access tokens if they
    # know this secret. This parameter is optional. In case it is not
    # provided in the configuration it is generated each time the server
    # starts. Thereby invalidating all previous distributed keys.
    # OPTIONAL

    # set how long reset token provided via email are valid (default 1 hour)
    email_token_validity_minutes: 60

    # If algorithm containers need direct communication between each other
    # the server also requires a VPN server. (!) This must be a EduVPN
    # instance as dataquality makes use of their API (!)
    # OPTIONAL

```

</details>**NOTE**: We use [DTAP for key environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development,_testing,_acceptance_and_production).
In short:


* `dev` Development environment. It is ok to break things here


* `test` Testing environment. Here, you can verify that everything
works as expected. This environment should resemble the target
environment where the final solution will be deployed as much as
possible.


* `acc` Acceptance environment. If the tests were successful, you can
try this environment, where the final user will test his/her analysis
to verify if everything meets his/her expectations.


* `prod` Production environment. The version of the proposed solution
where the final analyses are executed.

### Configuration wizard

The most straightforward way of creating a new server configuration is
using the command `vserver new` which allows you to configure most
settings. The Configure section details
what each setting represents.

By default, the configuration is stored at system level, which makes
this configuration available for *all* users. In case you want to use a
user directory you can add the `--user` flag when invoking the
`vserver new` command.

### Update configuration

To update a configuration you need to modify the created `yaml` file.
To see where this file is located you can use the command
`vserver files` . Do not forget to specify the flag `--system` in
case of a system-wide configuration or the flag `--user` in case of a
user-level configuration.

### Local test setup

If the nodes and the server run at the same machine, you have to make
sure that the node can reach the server.

**Windows and MacOS**

Setting the server IP to `0.0.0.0` makes the server reachable
at your localhost (this is also the case when the dockerized version
is used). In order for the node to reach this server, set the
`server_url` setting to `host.docker.internal`.


* **warning**

    On the **M1** mac the local server might not be reachable from
    your nodes as `host.docker.internal` does not seem to refer to the
    host machine. Reach out to us on Discourse for a solution if you need
    this!


**Linux**

You should bind the server to `0.0.0.0`. In the node
configuration files, you can then use `http://172.17.0.1`, assuming you use
the default docker network settings.

### Batch import

**WARNING**: All users that are imported using `vserver import` receive the superuser
role. We are looking into ways to also be able to import roles. For more
background info refer to this
[issue](https://github.com/dataquality/dataquality/issues/71).

You can easily create a set of test users, organizations and collaborations by
using a batch import. To do this, use the
`vserver import /path/to/file.yaml` command. An example `yaml` file is
provided here:

</details>## Logging

Logging is enabled by default. To configure the logger, look at the `logging`
section in the example configuration in Configuration file structure.

Useful commands:


1. `vserver files`: shows you where the log file is stored


2. `vserver attach`: show live logs of a running server in your
current console. This can also be achieved when starting the server
with `vserver start --attach`

## Shell

**WARNING**: The preferred method of managing entities is using the API, instead of the
shell interface. This because the API will perform validation of the input,
whereas in the shell all inputs are accepted.

Through the shell it is possible to manage all server entities. To start
the shell, use `vserver shell [options]`.

In the next sections the different database models that are available
are explained. You can retrieve any record and edit any property of it.
Every `db.` object has a `help()` method which prints some info on
what data is stored in it (e.g. `db.Organization.help()`).

**NOTE**: Donâ€™t forget to call `.save()` once you are done editing an object.

### Organizations

**NOTE**: Organizations have a public key that is used for end-to-end encryption.
This key is automatically created and/or uploaded by the node the first
time it runs.

To store an organization you can use the `db.Organization` model:

```python
# create new organiztion
organization = db.Organization(
    name="IKNL",
    domain="iknl.nl",
    address1="Zernikestraat 29",
    address2="Eindhoven",
    zipcode="5612HZ",
    country="Netherlands"
)

# store organization in the database
organization.save()
```

Retrieving organizations from the database:

```python
# get all organizations in the database
organizations = db.Organization.get()

# get organization by its unique id
organization = db.Organization.get(1)

# get organization by its name
organization = db.Organization.get_by_name("IKNL")
```

A lot of entities (e.g. users) at the server are connected to an
organization. E.g. you can see which (computation) tasks are issued by
the organization or see which collaborations it is participating in.

```python
# retrieve organization from which we want to know more
organization = db.Organization.get_by_name("IKNL")

# get all collaborations in which the organization participates
collaborations = organization.collaborations

# get all users from the organization
users = organization.users

# get all created tasks (from all users)
tasks = organization.created_tasks

# get the results of all these tasks
results = organization.results

# get all nodes of this organization (for each collaboration
# an organization participates in, it needs a node)
nodes = organization.nodes
```

### Roles and Rules

A user can have multiple roles and rules assigned to them. These are
used to determine if the user has permission to view, edit, create or
delete certain resources using the API. A role is a collection of rules.

```bash
# display all available rules
db.Rule.get()

# display rule 1
db.Rule.get(1)

# display all available roles
db.Role.get()

# display role 3
db.Role.get(3)

# show all rules that belong to role 3
db.Role.get(3).rules

# retrieve a certain rule from the DB
rule = db.Rule.get_by_("node", Scope, Operation)

# create a new role
role = db.Role(name="role-name", rules=[rule])
role.save()

# or assign the rule directly to the user
user = db.User.get_by_username("some-existing-username")
user.rules.append(rule)
user.save()
```

### Users

Users belong to an organization. So if you have not created any
Organizations yet, then you should do that first. To create a user
you can use the `db.User` model:

```python
# first obtain the organization to which the new user belongs
org = db.Organization.get_by_name("IKNL")

# obtain role 3 to assign to the new user
role_3 = db.Role.get(3)

# create the new users, see section Roles and Rules on how to
# deal with permissions
new_user = db.User(
    username="root",
    password="super-secret",
    firstname="John",
    lastname="Doe",
    roles=[role_3],
    rules=[],
    organization=org
)

# store the user in the database
new_user.save()
```

You can retrieve users in the following ways:

```python
# get all users
db.User.get()

# get user 1
db.User.get(1)

# get user by username
db.User.get_by_username("root")

# get all users from the organization IKNL
db.Organization.get_by_name("IKNL").users
```

To modify a user, simply adjust the properties and save the object.

```python
user = db.User.get_by_username("some-existing-username")

# update the firstname
user.firstname = "Brandnew"

# update the password; it is automatically hashed.
user.password = "something-new"

# store the updated user in the database
user.save()
```

### Collaborations

A collaboration consists of one or more organizations. To create a
collaboration you need at least one but preferably multiple
Organizations in your database. To create a
collaboration you can use the `db.Collaboration` model:

```python
# create a second organization to collaborate with
other_organization = db.Organization(
    name="IKNL",
    domain="iknl.nl",
    address1="Zernikestraat 29",
    address2="Eindhoven",
    zipcode="5612HZ",
    country="Netherlands"
)
other_organization.save()

# get organization we have created earlier
iknl = db.Organization.get_by_name("IKNL")

# create the collaboration
collaboration = db.Collaboration(
    name="collaboration-name",
    encrypted=False,
    organizations=[iknl, other_organization]
)

# store the collaboration in the database
collaboration.save()
```

Tasks, nodes and organizations are directly related to collaborations.
We can obtain these by:

```python
# obtain a collaboration which we like to inspect
collaboration = db.Collaboration.get(1)

# get all nodes
collaboration.nodes

# get all tasks issued for this collaboration
collaboration.tasks

# get all organizations
collaboration.organizations
```

**WARNING**: Setting the encryption to False at the server does not mean that the nodes
will send encrypted results. This is only the case if the nodes also agree
on this setting. If they donâ€™t, you will receive an error message.

### Nodes

Before nodes can login, they need to exist in the serverâ€™s database. A
new node can be created as follows:

```python
# we'll use a uuid as the API-key, but you can use anything as
# API key
from uuid import uuid1

# nodes always belong to an organization *and* a collaboration,
# this combination needs to be unique!
iknl = db.Organization.get_by_name("IKNL")
collab = iknl.collaborations[0]

# generate and save
api_key = str(uuid1())
print(api_key)

node = db.Node(
    name = f"IKNL Node - Collaboration {collab.name}",
    organization = iknl,
    collaboration = collab,
    api_key = api_key
)

# save the new node to the database
node.save()
```

**NOTE**: API keys are hashed before stored in the database. Therefore you need to
save the API key immediately. If you lose it, you can reset the API key
later via the shell, API, client or UI.

### Tasks and Results

**WARNING**: Tasks(/results) created from the shell are not picked up by nodes that are
already running. The signal to notify them of a new task cannot be emitted
this way. We therefore recommend sending tasks via the Python client.

A task is intended for one or more organizations. For each organization
the task is intended for, a corresponding (initially empty) result
should be created. Each task can have multiple results, for example a
result from each organization.

```python
# obtain organization from which this task is posted
iknl = db.Organization.get_by_name("IKNL")

# obtain collaboration for which we want to create a task
collaboration = db.Collaboration.get(1)

# obtain the next run_id. Tasks sharing the same run_id
# can share the temporary volumes at the nodes. Usually this
# run_id is assigned through the API (as the user is not allowed
# to do so). All tasks from a master-container share the
# same run_id
run_id = db.Task.next_run_id()

task = db.Task(
    name="some-name",
    description="some human readable description",
    image="docker-registry.org/image-name",
    collaboration=collaboration,
    run_id=run_id,
    database="default",
    initiator=iknl,
)
task.save()

# input the algorithm container (docker-registry.org/image-name)
# expects
input_ = {
}

import datetime

# now create a result model for each organization within the
# collaboration. This could also be a subset
for org in collaboration.organizations:
    res = db.Result(
        input=input_,
        organization=org,
        task=task,
        assigned_at=datetime.datetime.now()
    )
    res.save()
```

Tasks can have a child/parent relationship. Note that the `run_id` is
for parent and child tasks the same.

```python
# get a task to which we want to create some
# child tasks
parent_task = db.Task.get(1)

child_task = db.Task(
    name="some-name",
    description="some human readable description",
    image="docker-registry.org/image-name",
    collaboration=collaboration,
    run_id=parent_task.run_id,
    database="default",
    initiator=iknl,
    parent=parent_task
)
child_task.save()
```

**NOTE**: Tasks that share a `run_id` have access to the same temporary folder at
the node. This allows for multi-stage algorithms.

Obtaining results:

```python
# obtain all Results
db.Result.get()

# obtain only completed results
[result for result in db.Result.get() if result.complete]

# obtain result by its unique id
db.Result.get(1)
```
