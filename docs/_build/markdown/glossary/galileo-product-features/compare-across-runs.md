# Compare across Runs

Training a model requires many runs, many iterations on the data and a lot of experiments across models and the parameters. This can quickly get messy to track.

Once you have created multiple Runs per Project within Galileo, it becomes critical to analyze and quantify progression or regression in terms of key metrics (F1, DEP, etc) for the whole dataset as well as critical subsets.

Galileo provides you with a single comparison view across all Runs within a Project or across Projects.&#x20;
