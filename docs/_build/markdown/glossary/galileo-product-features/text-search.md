# Text Search

To make error discovery blazingly fast, Galileo provides a **text search feature**. With Galileo you can simply type text into the search bar to observe your model's performance on the subset of samples containing this text.&#x20;

As an example we showcase a model's performance over all samples containing the word "masterpiece" (632 samples or 3% of training data). Using the insights pane we see that on this dataset slice the model has an F1 score of **0.80**. Further analysis of the insights pane, the dataset view, and embedding view enables additional insights on these samples. &#x20;
