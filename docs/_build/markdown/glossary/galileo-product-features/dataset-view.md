# Dataset View

The Dataset View provides an interactive data table for inspecting your datasets. Individual data samples from your dataset or selected data subset are shown, where each sample is a row in the table. In addition to the text, a sample's associated gold label, predicted label, and DEP score are included as data attribute columns. By default, the samples are sorted by decreasing DEP score.&#x20;

### Customization

As shown below, the Dataset View can be customized in the following ways:

* Dynamic resizing
* Selecting and de-selecting dataset columns
* Selecting specific gold and predicted class labels

### Data Selection

Each row or data sample can be selected to perform an action. As demonstrated in [Test Drive Galileo - Movie Reviews](../../galileo-console-guides/multi-class-text-classification/using-galileo-effectively-for-multi-class-use-cases.md#identify-annotation-errors), we can easily identify and export data samples with annotation errors for relabeling and/or further inspection. See [Actions](actions.md) for more details.
