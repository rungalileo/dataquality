# ðŸ‘¥ Setting Up New Users

### What is a Galileo User?

Each person has their own account with Galileo with their own login credentials.

Each Galileo User needs to provide their own credentials to the Galileo client when training their models such that their runs are logged under, and visible in their individual Galileo console.

### How to create the Admin User?

You should have an Admin User created during the deployment step. If we did not create one, the Galileo console will prompt you to create the Admin User first:

![Galileo Console (URL: console.galileo.companyname.\[com|ai|ioâ€¦\])](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-04-21 at 3.30.47 PM.png>)

### How to Add a new user?

The Admin User has the ability to invite users to set up their own accounts with Galileo.

### How to manage user permissions?

**Coming Soon!**  The Galileo Command Center allows Admin Users to upgrade other users to Admins as well as get a bird's eye view of all the runs happening across the team!
