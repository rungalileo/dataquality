# 🚀 Getting Started

> ⚡️Add a few lines of code while training your model with labeled data, or during an inference run with unlabeled data, to **instantly find (and fix) data errors**, or **select the right data** to label next.
>
> Galileo enables data scientists to build **high performing models fast, with better quality training data.**

### **🔭 Inspect data. Discover errors. Fix. Repeat.**

### 🏁  Let's get setup!

• [Install the Galileo Python client (dataquality)](getting-started/setup-installing-galileo.md)

• [\[Enterprise Users Only\] Setup User Roles and Permissions](enterprise-only/enterprise-only/setting-up-new-users.md)

### ☝🏼 Or, Let's start with your use case

1️⃣  [Quickly upload your data, inspect and fix](getting-started/1-get-started-add-your-data-to-galileo.md)

2️⃣  [\[Training/Labeled data\] Connect to your own model](getting-started/byom-bring-your-own-model/)

3️⃣  [\[Production/Unlabeled data\] Data Drift and Model Monitoring](getting-started/2-model-monitoring-and-data-drift-with-production-or-unlabeled-data/)
