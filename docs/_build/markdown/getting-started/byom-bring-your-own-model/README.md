# BYOM - Bring Your Own Model



Galileo offers a number of custom framework integrations to help you hook Galileo into your training flow.

If you have a well-trained model and want to understand its performance on your data, or you are looking to deploy an existing model and monitor it with Galileo, our custom framework integrations allow you to quickly fix and find data error across your model's lifecycle.
