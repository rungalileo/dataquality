# Text Classification



Text classification is a sequence classification problem, where given an input document, the task is to correctly classify it into one of the given target classes. Here's an example:

```
input = "Perfectly works fine after 10 years, would highly recommend. Great buy!!"
output = "positive review"

input = "The product did not last long, and was bad quality"
output = "negative review"
```
