Welcome to `auto`, your newest superpower in the world of Machine Learning!

We know now that **more** data isnâ€™t the answer, **better** data is. But how do you find that data? We already know the answer to that: âœ¨Galileoâœ¨

But how do you get started now, and iterate quickly with _**data-centric**_ techniques?

Enter: `dq.auto` the secret sauce to instant data insights. We handle the training, you focus on the data.

### What is auto?

`dq.auto` is a helper function to train the most cutting-edge transformer (or any of your choosing from HuggingFace) on your dataset so it can be processed by Galileo. You provide the data, let Galileo train the model, and youâ€™re off to the races.

The goal of this tool, and Galileo at large, is to build a data-centric view of machine learning. Keep your model static and iterate on the dataset until itâ€™s well-formed and well-representative of your problem space. This is the path to robust and stable ML models.

### What is auto _not?_

`auto` is _**not**_ an AutoML tool. It will not perform hyperparameter tuning, and will not search through a gallery of models to optimize every percentage of f1.

In fact, `auto` is quite the opposite. It intentionally keeps the model static, forcing you to understand and fix your data to improve performance.

### Why?

It turns out that in many (most) cases, **you donâ€™t need to train your own model to find data insights**. In fact, you often donâ€™t need to build your own custom model at all! [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/), and in particular [transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index), has brought the most cutting-edge deep learning algorithms straight to your fingertips, allowing you to leverage the best research has to offer in 1 line of code.

Transformer models have consistently outperformed their predecessors, and HuggingFace is constantly updating their fleet of _free_ models for anyone to download.

So if you donâ€™t _need_ to build a custom model anymore, why not let Galileo do it for you?
{% endhint %}

### Get Started

Simply install: `pip install --upgrade dataquality`

and use!

```python
import dataquality as dq

# Get insights on the official 'emotion' dataset
dq.auto(hf_data="emotion")
```

You can also provide data as files or pandas dataframes

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups
import dataquality as dq

# Load the newsgroups dataset from sklearn
newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='train')
newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='test')
# Convert to pandas dataframes
df_train = pd.DataFrame({"text": newsgroups_train.data, "label": newsgroups_train.target})
df_test = pd.DataFrame({"text": newsgroups_test.data, "label": newsgroups_test.target})

dq.auto(
     train_data=df_train, 
     test_data=df_test, 
     labels=newsgroups_train.target_names,
     project_name="newsgroups_work", 
     run_name="run_1_raw_data"
)
```

`dq.auto` works for:

* Text Classification datasets (given columns `text` and `label`). [Trec6 Example.](https://huggingface.co/datasets/rungalileo/trec6)
* NER datasets (give columns `tokens` and `tags` or `ner_tags`). [MIT\_movies Example.](https://huggingface.co/datasets/rungalileo/mit\_movies)

`auto` will automatically figure out your task and start the process for you.
